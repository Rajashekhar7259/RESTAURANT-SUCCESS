**Problem Statement :**
In a competitive market like the restaurant industry, understanding the factors that influence business success is crucial for stakeholders. Utilizing the Yelp dataset, this project aims to investigate the relationship between user engagement (reviews, tips, and check-ins) and business success metrics (review count, ratings) for restaurants.

**Research Objectives :**
Quantify the correlation between user engagement (reviews, tips, check-ins) and review count/average star rating: This will help us determine if restaurants with higher user engagement experience a corresponding increase in reviews and ratings.

Analyze the impact of sentiment on review count and average star rating: We will investigate if positive sentiment in reviews and tips translates to higher star ratings and potentially influences the total number of reviews left.

Time trends in User Engagement: We will explore if consistent user engagement over time is a stronger indicator of long-term success compared to sporadic bursts of activity.

**Hypothesis Testing :**
Higher levels of user engagement (more reviews, tips, and check-ins) correlate with higher review counts and ratings for restaurants.
Positive sentiment expressed in reviews and tips contributes to higher overall ratings and review counts for restaurants.
Consistent engagement over time is positively associated with sustained business success for restaurants.

**Recommendations :**
Utilizing insights from the analysis of various metrics such as user engagement, sentiment of reviews, peak hours, and the impact of elite users, businesses can make informed decisions to drive success.

Understanding customer preferences, behavior, and satisfaction levels is paramount. Businesses should focus on delivering exceptional experiences to meet customer expectations.

By leveraging data on peak hours and user engagement, businesses can optimize staffing levels, resource allocation, and operating hours to ensure efficiency and quality service delivery during high-demand periods.

Positive reviews from elite users and high user engagement can boost a business's online visibility and reputation. Maintaining active engagement with customers and responding promptly to feedback is crucial for building credibility and attracting new customers.

Collaborating with elite users and leveraging their influence can amplify promotional efforts, increase brand awareness, and drive customer acquisition. Building strong relationships with key stakeholders, including loyal customers, can further strengthen a business's position in the market.

Businesses can adjust their operating hours or introduce special promotions to capitalize on the increased demand during peak hours.

Less successful businesses may need to focus on strategies to enhance user engagement over time, such as improving service quality, responding to customer feedback.
Cities with high success scores presents opportunities for restaurant chains to expand or invest further.
